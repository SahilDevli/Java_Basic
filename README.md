# Java Overview

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language known for its security, robustness, and scalability. Key features include WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere), automatic memory management (Garbage Collection), multi-threading, and a rich standard library. It is widely used in enterprise applications, web development, and mobile applications.

# OOP Principles in Java

Encapsulation – Restricting direct access to data using private variables and getters/setters.
Inheritance – A class acquires properties and behaviors of another class (extends keyword).
Polymorphism – Ability of methods to take multiple forms (Method Overloading & Overriding).
Abstraction – Hiding implementation details using abstract classes and interfaces.
